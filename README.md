<h1>Building a Weather Ready Nation for All </h1>
We are working with the South Carolina Department of Health and Control (DHEC) in order to design an app that fills out and stores forms digitally in order to educate users on preparation for hazards in case of inclement weather events. Users will be able to upload photos to shows damage within communities, and fill out forms in order to get their prepardness documented. Coded in Flutter with REST Architecture, Firebase Database, Backend Springboot, and Google Cloud.
